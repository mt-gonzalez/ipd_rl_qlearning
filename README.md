# How an AI agent would do against the most known strategies in a Prisoner's Dilemma game? #

Inspired by a **Veritasium** youtube video (for which I leave the [link](https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=_x8VNLGAr5WZFAwM) here!) I decided to do my *first ever* project to put in practice my programming capabilities and my ML/AI knowledge.

This project is a hands-on exploration of programming and AI concepts, aiming to simulate the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. I will train an AI agent to analyze how it performs against well-known strategies in this classic game theory problem.

## Objective ##

The main goals of this project are:

- To develop an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game environment,
- with an implement of various well-known strategies for the game.
- To train an AI agent to play the game and evaluate its performance.
- To gain insights into how the AI adapts and learns in this context.

## Environment Setup ##

This project uses a Conda environment to simplify dependency management. You can find all necessary dependencies listed in the environment.yml file for easy setup.
Dependencies

Hereâ€™s a list of the key libraries and tools used in this project:

- Python 3.12.7: Core programming language.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: To create visualizations and graphs.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pytest: To ensure robust testing of the codebase.
- JupyterLab: For interactive development and experimentation.
- Gymnasium: To structure the game environment.
